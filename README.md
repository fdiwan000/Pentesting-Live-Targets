# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLi Injection

Description: I performed SQL injection in the URl for Green and Red which redirect me to Salesperson Page but for Blue target, it shows that database query failed. Which allow attacker to know that Blue target can be exploited via SQL injection

Vulnerability #2: Session HiJack

Description: I used forefox and google chrome for this. I logged into Blue Target in Firefox and than retrived session key. I opened Blue Target on chrome and verified that it was not logged in, I used same method to change the session key to what I retrieved from Firefox. By going back to main page, I confirms that user logged into Blue target in Chrome without authentication

## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

Description: I tried logging in via jmonroe99, user which exists in database and received logging error message in bold as I do not know password but when I try to log in as jmonroe (user doesnt exist) I get back unbolded error message. This allow hacker to know if a user exists in database

Vulnerability #2: XSS

Description: Under this, anyone in contact feedback form can inject scripts which is being accepted.

Vulnerability #3 (BONUS): XSS_Redirect

Description: Under this, I was able to inject a script which redirect to other URL. I chose it to redirect to google.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

Description: Here I could exploit IDOR by changing the IDs in URL and allow me to access users who should be hidden and private, then I tried it on Blue Target to show that its not vulnerable as Red target

Vulnerability #2: CSRF

Description: For this I used Burp. I tried updating a user in blue target which allow to get the POST request. I was able to modify it by making CSRF token "none" and then send request. As you can see the exploit didnt worked on Blue target but it worked on Red Target as I was able to change the name

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
**It was not much challenge to find Bonus exploit, I just had to find out right script injection to redirect to other URL**
